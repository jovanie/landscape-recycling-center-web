      <h1>Recycled Products</h1>
      <p>Materials brought to LRC are processed into mulches and composts that are 100% natural with no additives or chemical dyes. All mulches are made from indigenous woods that are by-products of local tree maintenance--no exotic, Canadian,
        Pacific Northwest or South American Rainforest wood species. Other products such as granite fines, asphalt millings and street pavers are materials that have been specifically salvaged for recycling. First-time customers are encouraged to
        visit our site to learn the differences between our products prior to purchase.</p>

      <p>LRC products are sold in bulk, so please bring your own vehicle/containers/bags. Don't have a way to transport our products to your home or business? <a
