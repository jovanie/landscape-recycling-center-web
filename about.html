				<h1>About</h1>
				<h2>What is LRC?</h2>
				<p>Started in 1987, this not-for-profit facility was created to divert yard debris from over-crowded landfills, which account for an overwhelming 25% of all waste in Illinois.</p>
				<p>LRC uses ecological and economical methods to recycle yard waste such as grass clippings, brush and plant cuttings into lawn and garden composts, topsoil, and mulches that are available for purchase by residents and companies in Champaign
					County and the surrounding area.</p>
				<p>We also partner with schools, churches and community gardens to provide recycled mulches and compost at reduced/no cost.</p>
				<p>Operated by the City of Urbana Public Works department under a cooperative agreement between the cities of Champaign and Urbana, LRC is <a href="findus.html">open year-round</a>. When visiting our facility, please be aware that you must
					check in at the gate no later than 30 minutes prior to closing time.</p>
				<p>NOTE: This intergovernmental facility, its agents and/or employees make no gaurantee or warranty of the products available at this facility and assume no liability for any damages that may occur to persons or property while on the Site.
