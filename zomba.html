				<h1>LRC Inspires Facility in Africa</h1>

				<p>As part of Urbana's Sister City partnership with Zomba, Malawi, several Zomba city administrators visited the Landscape Recycling Center in March 2013, leading to Zomba now operating their own compost-making facility. </p>
				<p>Ranked among the world's least developed countries, Malawi — landlocked in southeast Africa — gains more than one-third of its GDP and 90 percent of export revenues from agriculture, but the nation's soil is of poor quality.
					Based in part on the LRC model, the Malawians developed a system of separating organic material from inorganic material in trash collections, then processing the organic material into compost.
				</p>
				<p>The new facility is selling the compost to help Malawians grow vegetables and flowers, with a special emphasis on assistance in urban areas.
				</p>
				<p>Through a grant from the Gates Foundation, the City of Urbana previously worked with Zomba on construction of pit toilets for three primary schools, and the construction of toilet stalls, showers, laundry tubs and a clothes drying yard for
					the family members living in temporary quarters adjacent to the Zomba Central Hospital. These men and women, often from remote areas, serve as guardians for their relatives in the hospital, providing clean clothing, bedding, meals, and
					other care on a daily basis. Urbana's Sister City partnership with Zomba began in 2008.</p>
